- **Green Spaces**: 1073 parks, 49890.8 ha
- **Green Space per Capita**: 366.8 m²/person
- **WHO Standard (9 m²/person)**: ✓ Met

## Accessibility Results

| Walking Distance | Population Served | Percentage Served |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 400m (5 min)     | 1,271,609 | 93.5% |
| 800m (10 min)    | 1,338,449 | 98.4% |

## Equity Analysis

- **Income-Accessibility Correlation**: 0.023
- **Elderly-Accessibility Correlation**: -0.029
- **Children-Accessibility Correlation**: -0.052
- **Critical Areas Identified**: 57 areas with high vulnerability and low accessibility

## Park Network Analysis

- **Cells with No Park Access**: 100 population cells
- **Cells with Multiple Parks**: 645 population cells
- **Park Clusters Identified**: 2 natural park clusters

## Key Findings

1. **Accessibility Coverage**: 98.4% of the population has access to green spaces within a 10-minute walk.
2. **Equity Concerns**: No significant equity issues detected based on income correlation.
3. **Vulnerable Populations**: 49,508 people in critical areas with high vulnerability and low accessibility.
4. **Park Distribution**: The majority of parks (926) are small neighborhood parks.

## Recommendations

1. **Targeted Interventions**: Focus on 57 critical areas with high vulnerability and low accessibility.
2. **Park Size Diversity**: Consider developing larger district parks to serve more people effectively.
3. **Equity Considerations**: No specific equity-focused interventions needed.
4. **Connectivity Improvements**: Enhance pedestrian connectivity to existing parks, especially in underserved areas.
5. **New Park Locations**: Consider 9 potential sites for new parks in high-need areas.

## Methodology
