# Milan Green Space Accessibility Analysis - Comprehensive Report

## Executive Summary

- **Total Population**: 1,360,000
- **Green Spaces**: 1073 parks, 49890.8 ha
- **Green Space per Capita**: 366.8 m²/person
- **WHO Standard (9 m²/person)**: ✓ Met

## Accessibility Results

| Walking Distance | Population Served | Percentage Served |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 400m (5 min)     | 1,271,609 | 93.5% |
| 800m (10 min)    | 1,338,449 | 98.4% |

## Equity Analysis

- **Income-Accessibility Correlation**: 0.023
- **Elderly-Accessibility Correlation**: -0.029
- **Children-Accessibility Correlation**: -0.052

## Park Distribution

| Park Type | Count | Total Area (ha) | Mean Area (ha) | Median Area (ha) | Std Area (ha) | Min Area (ha) | Max Area (ha) |
|----------|-------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| District Park | 126.0 | 649.3 | 5.2 | 3.5 | 4.0 | 2.0 | 18.3 |
| Neighborhood Park | 926.0 | 472.0 | 0.5 | 0.3 | 0.4 | 0.1 | 2.0 |
| Regional Park | 21.0 | 48769.4 | 2322.3 | 54.4 | 10223.0 | 20.3 | 46933.5 |


## Key Findings

1. **Accessibility Coverage**: 98.4% of the population has access to green spaces within a 10-minute walk.
2. **Equity Concerns**: No significant equity issues detected based on income correlation.
3. **Park Size Distribution**: The majority of parks (926) are small neighborhood parks.

## Recommendations

1. **Targeted Interventions**: Focus on areas with low accessibility scores, particularly those with high population density.
2. **Park Size Diversity**: Consider developing larger district parks to serve more people effectively.
3. **Equity Considerations**: No specific equity-focused interventions needed.
4. **Connectivity Improvements**: Enhance pedestrian connectivity to existing parks, especially in underserved areas.
